\item
    There is reason to~$\rfrac{0}{0}=0$.
\item
    An unordered pair of qubits is described
        by the C$^*$-algebra~$M_3 \oplus \mathbb{C}$.
\item
    A Kochen--Specker system has at least 22 vectors.
\item
    In practice there is no tangible benefit
        to quantum key distribution over traditional key-agreemenent protocols.
\item
    Perhaps the only thing that prevents JBW-algebras from replacing
            von Neumann algebras is
            the lack of a phyisically meaningful notion
            of process between them
            such as that of a normal completely positive linear map
            between von Neumann algebras.
\item
    When cooking,
        the only thing worse than adding too much salt,
        is adding the salt too late.
