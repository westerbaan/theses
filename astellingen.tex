Von Neumann algebras
though 80 years old
need not be replaced.
\item
A key to positivity is inversion --- both in  $C^*$-algebras,
and in life.
\item
Coalgebraists might find a use
for  descriptive set theory.
\item
    The subcategory $\textbf{haW}^*_\text{\textsc{cpsu}}$
        of~$\textbf{W}^*_\text{\textsc{cpsu}}$ from
        \textsf{84b\,II}
        is not closed under the
         Paschke dilations from \textsf{140\,III}.

%\item
%The theory of von Neumann algebras
%can be developed without mentioning
%the spectral theorem.
\item
The definition of personal data
in the GDPR lacks limitation.
\item
AlphaStar shows masterfully calibrated
intuition, but no reason.
%\item
%Artificial intelligence will  mental illnesses, just like us.
%\item
%Breadth, not consistency, is a sign of truth;
%quite the opposite.
%\item
%Von Neumann algebras form a model of the quantum lambda calculus.
%\item
%The sequential product can be axiomatised in the category of von Neumann
%algebras.
%\item
%Forceful optimism
%invites prevarication, silence,
%and their pal, decay.
%\item
%Mediocrity is sticky.
%\item
%Taking offence where none was intended
%is either just foolish\dots{} or cruel.
%\item
%A tragedy:
%IQ is distributed normally,
%but success is not.
%\item
%There's more to gardening
%than adding and crossbreeding exciting new species.
%We scholars should take note.
\item
Dissection kills the animal;
analysis kills the concept.
%\item
%Lies betray themselves by their
%unnatural consistency.
%\item
%For all practical purposes
%magic is a placeholder for better
%articulated understanding.
%\item
%The fabric
%of reality,
%like the fabric of people,
%bares no blame.
%\item
%In highly civilised society
%there isn't quite enough serious input
%for our hard-wired ``knight program'',
%but the ``knave program'' comes along just fine.
